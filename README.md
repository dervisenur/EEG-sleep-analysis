# EEG-sleep-analysis

Tests of different approaches to EEG sleep analysis, on individual polysomnograpic recordings from the publicly available [Sleep-EDF Expanded](https://physionet.org/pn4/sleep-edfx/) database.
Currently only contains classification based on the discrete Hidden Markov model (DHMM) and feature extraction in the frequency domain (different band ratios).
